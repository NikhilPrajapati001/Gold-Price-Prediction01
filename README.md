# Gold-Price-Prediction01
The notebook focuses on Gold Price Prediction using a machine learning approach. The main topic is predicting the price of gold based on historical financial data, including indicators such as the S&P 500 index, crude oil prices, silver prices, and exchange rates. Here's a summary of the steps:

Data Import and Preprocessing:

Import necessary libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and machine learning tools from sklearn.
Load a dataset that includes gold prices (GLD) along with other financial indicators.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyze the relationships between various features (e.g., SPX, USO, SLV) and the gold price.
Visualize data patterns using tools like seaborn and matplotlib.
Model Building:

The RandomForestRegressor model from the sklearn library is used to predict the price of gold.
The data is split into training and testing sets using train_test_split.
Model Evaluation:

Use performance metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared to evaluate the prediction accuracy of the model.
Prediction:

The trained model is used to predict future gold prices based on the financial data provided.
